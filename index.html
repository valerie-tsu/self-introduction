      <p><strong>About me</strong> - In July 2019, I started my postgraduate course in <a href = "https://www.anu.edu.au/"target="_blank">ANU</a>, which is a national university located at Canberra. I have stayed at Canberra for three semesters. Canberra is a peaceful city which I like very much. Currently, due to the impact of Corona virus, I have stuck in China and not been able to return to campus. Corona virus did not only change the pattern of my study, but also changed the way of living. Under the  rule of keeping social distance, I have to spend more time at home. Luckily, I am the kind of people who prefer to stay alone and play games. </p>
      <p><strong>My passion</strong> - Under the impact of epidemic, video game is a more reachable way for entertainment. More and more people choose to stay at home and play video games with their family. As reported, Nintendo has reached the peak sales under the epidemic period. I have around 10-year-experience of online game playing. For video games, I am familiar with  current marketing favourite, such as <a href ="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/"target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, PSP, <a href = "https://www.nintendo.com/switch/"target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. I also have tried more than 20 video games. This website intends to give a brief introduction of video games on marking, including the comparison of consoles, games, prices. Hoping to help new users to select an ideal product to play.</p>
