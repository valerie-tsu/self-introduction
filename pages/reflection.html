      <h3>Some Thing Original</h3>
	  <p>After using Premiere Pro to edit video, I found some thing interesting, which is creating meme. Meme is very popular in online chatting APP such as Wechat, WhatsApp. I edit the some chip of the video games to creat own meme.Self-made meme has my own preference and could express my feeling better. The procedure is very simple. Just need to chip the video and then translate the video into .gif format. There are plenty of free website which can transfer the format of mp4 into .gif. The whole process of making meme would cost no more than 5 minutes but the fun is infinite, especially I can share the fun with my friends.
	  <p>The below are two examples of meme which I made by myself, the pikachu is aim to cheer up, while the swimming boy intend to show that I do not want to talk currently. They are all from the video game I have played. In chatting with my friends, instead of typing words, the meme is more direct to show the feelings. So I enjoy making it quite a lot. </p>

	  <h3>About my site</h3>
      <p>As a started in web design,in the journey of this assignment,I have met many challenges before solving these problems.When I reflect on what I have learned, I found several points useful for me. 
	  <p><strong>First</strong>, A user-friendly tool is very important for new users as me. I have tried several different software or webpage to complete this assignment. There are some very efficient tools such as Dreamweaver,Premiere Pro . For Dreamweaver, it enables me to view the final design effect immediately. while for Premiere Pro, it is so powerful and easy to get familar with as it has tutorial for new starters. These tools saved me a lot of time and achieve a better result.</p>
	  
	  <p><strong>Second</strong>, I found W3school is a useful place to learn. I have searched many command from W3school and it provides clear explaination to learn. Besides, W3school also provide templates. For instance, it provide the template for photo gallery. As adjusting CSS is not easy for me, From the template, I have got an overview and feel easier to start my work.</p>
	  
      <p><strong>Third</strong> Piazza is fast way to solve problems and a good platform to learn. Some problems are not easy find the answer online.If I post on Pizza, there are tutors and classmates can give me direction very soon. Instead of spending a lot time to find the way blindly, I found Piazza is a good way to ask. I have posted nearly 10 questions regarding this assignment, and got satisfied solution for all of them. By solving these problems, I also improved my skill of webdesign.
